<p>Patrick was a beloved member of the community, and genuinely enjoyed people - hearing your stories, meeting family members, and supporting community events. He so enjoyed having you all in his life. <strong>This memorial event is open to anyone who would like to pay their respects to Patrick and his family</strong>.</p>

<p>Patrick was most spiritual and free, rising and falling with ocean waves on one of his 5 surfboards. And every chance he could, he brought our daughters to the water - swimming in the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/parks-recreation-culture/parks-trails/find-park-trail/sooke-potholes">Pot Holes</a>, walking along <a href="http://discoversooke.com/outdoor-activities/parks-trails/whiffen-spit/">Whiffen Spit</a>, and learning to surf in <a href="https://www.tourismtofino.com/tofino-beaches">Tofino</a> and <a href="http://www.juandefucamarinetrail.com/china_beach.html">China Beach</a>.</p>

<p>Please join us in remembering Patrick in one of the places he was most happy. We will meet in the parking lot of Whiffen Spit at 10:00 AM. Please join us afterwards for food, and to help create a giant memory board for his girls. Bring photos, bring memories, bring stories, poems, encouragement… and we’ll provide markers, crayons, glue and other creative bits and pieces to help.</p>

<p>If you have any questions you can send them to irwinfamilysooke@gmail.com</p>
