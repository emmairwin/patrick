<p>In the last year and half, Patrick bravely battled cancer. You can never truly understand the level of courage it takes to endure chemotherapy, it’s effects, and the mental assault of continued bad news, and realization of impending loss - until you live, or witness it. Patrick did everything he could to stay here with his girls, he is truly our hero and it was heartbreaking to see him endure so much. We miss him terribly.</p>

<p>As horrific as our journey has been, we were allowed to focus on Patrick, and our girls through the generosity of so many people. So many people… that I could never list everyone here, however there are a number of people that I do want to include by name - because without them we would never have made it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Manon &amp; Kim</strong> - treasured friends, who have gone above and beyond, for the girls, and for Patrick and I - in everything from taking Daisy to appointments on the mainland, attending IEP meetings, helping me read through books on grieving for children, and organizing final arrangements for Patrick. Also a new bed for Daisy, and endless hugs. I nkow each time they visited Patrick was so so happy.</li>
  <li><strong>Mary Dunn</strong> - was our ‘nurse in residence’, a tremendous friend, helped us through every stage of this journey with kindness and strength. Mary has been a guardian angel and rock for both of us, and someone the girls know they can count on.</li>
  <li><strong>Auntie Geraldine</strong>. My auntie travelled from England, to be with us this year - a steady presence immersed in the day to day of our tragedy - there for the girls when I could not be. Auntie’s kindness and love was a steady source of comfort and strength.</li>
  <li><strong>Les and Elaine Hadadd</strong> - Les &amp; Elaine, even with their own family and jobs were there for our family, week after week. Often bringing us nutritious meals, running children back and forth, taking the children into their home so that I could work.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sheila Dobie</strong> - Molly would never have made it through the hockey season were not for Sheila, who early in the season ensured Molly was on her son Angus’s team - and drove Molly to most of her hockey games, and practices. Sheila was also a provider of beautiful meals for Patrick and our family on days we didn’t have the energy to put meals together.<br /></p>

    <p><br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Denyse Koo</strong> - was there in the office when Patrick was first diagnosed, our champion when Daisy was in treatment, Denyse again has been there for us. In most recent days Denyse has been incredibly kind helping the children with puppy visits. We would also like to thank Denyse for making donation of a new washer and dryer possible via a Donation from Golf for Kids 2016, and for bone broth soup made for Patrick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mozilla</strong> - My employer and my colleagues have been incredibly supportive during this year. Allowing me to take time off last year, and again now to adjust with the children to losing Patrick.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Robin Stewart</strong> - Robin, is always, always the first person to offer to help and she has been there for us again in many ways. Robin is the reason Molly was able to attend the majority of her othodonist appointments - and is one of the leaders of the amazing online auction.</li>
  <li><strong>Richard Watts</strong> - Patrick’s cousin who also happens to be a genetic researcher. Richard ensured that all options for hope and treatment were researched; that no stone was left uncovered. It meant a lot to Patrick to have Rich in his corner. -</li>
  <li><strong>Marilyn Harris</strong> - There for us since the first time we met her as a volunteer at BCCH. Marilyn helped us get the kids to Camp Goodtimes, has been incredibly generous helping with fresh groceries, and as a shoulder to cry on and advocate. Grateful for Marilyn.</li>
  <li><strong>Victoria Hospice</strong> - Dr. Gail, Dr. McGregor, Dr. Christian Weins, the entire staff of nurses, doctors and volunteers were incredible in supporting our family during our difficult time there.</li>
  <li><strong>Sooke Hopsice</strong> - Tremendous gratitude for the support of Sooke Hospice, especially to Toya, and our dear volunteers Marika and Jane. Folding laundry, gardening with the children, helping with meals, walking the dog… we were held up on many days by the generosity of these volunteers, who we consider now as friends.</li>
  <li><strong>West Coast Medical</strong> - Dr. Forsburg, and wonderful staff at our doctors office who advocated for Patrick, and ultimately resulted in his transfer to the first Hopsice bed opened in Sooke at Ayre Manor.</li>
  <li><strong>Calgary Friends</strong> - Brian, Merry, Trent, Lisa, Brett, July - who made the trip out to Sooke several times this year. The children have become very close with our friends, and their children, which has meant a lot. For Patrick having his dear friends make the trip to be there for him, meant everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Bob &amp; Dana</strong> - Dana and Bob have been there for us, in so many ways I cannot list. From home made granola and other delicious meals - to last-minute sleepovers, and a shoulder to cry on - grateful for our dear friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Mary &amp; Denise</strong> - Even more friends who stopped in to help when we couldn’t help ourselves. Our outdoor laundry line, and various fixed things in the house are a reflection of their kindess. Also hugs, good hugs.</li>
  <li><strong>Gwen Fisher</strong> - From Pure Elements, Gwen has been incredibly kind, including stopping in at hospice for hair cuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Dave Campbell</strong> - Patrick’s good friend, who took both of us for a memorable plan ride over the island, and has been strong for us despite his own loss of daughter Molly to cancer. Dave organized our GoFundMe page.</li>
  <li><strong>Darcie, Robin and others organizing the auction online</strong> An incredible amount of organization, dedication has gone into that auction. So grateful.</li>
  <li><strong>Everyone who has donated to our GoFundMe, or in other ways</strong> Without you we would be struggling, and falling further backwards into debt. Thanks to you , I am able to take some unpaid time off work to be with the girls.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I said, this is just a short list - will add more names as I can…</p>
