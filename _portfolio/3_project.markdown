**What**: Patrick Irwin Memorial Walk<br>
**When**: Saturday, April 8th 10:00 AM<br>
**Where**: Whiffen Spit<br>
**Afterwards**: TBA (food/reception)

Patrick was most spiritual and free, rising and falling with ocean waves on one of his 5 surfboards. And every chance he could, he brought our daughters to the water - swimming in the [Pot Holes](https://www.crd.bc.ca/parks-recreation-culture/parks-trails/find-park-trail/sooke-potholes), walking along [Whiffen Spit](http://discoversooke.com/outdoor-activities/parks-trails/whiffen-spit/), and learning to surf in [Tofino](https://www.tourismtofino.com/tofino-beaches) and [China Beach](http://www.juandefucamarinetrail.com/china_beach.html).

Patrick was a beloved member of the community, and genuinely loved people - hearing your stories, meeting family members, supporting community events. This memorial walk is open to anyone who would like to pay their respects to Patrick's family, and to walk in his memory.

Patrick's **public** memorial will be a walk at Whiffen Spit. Please join us in remembering Patrick in one of the places he was most happy. We will meet in the parking lot at 10:00 AM, a simple reception is also being organized.
